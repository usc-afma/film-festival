Our Film Festival is an annual showcase of talented filmmakers from North America film schools. We aim to create a 
platform for student filmmakers, industry professionals, and investors to meet and share with each other. This annual 
festival takes place each spring in Los Angeles, California and features screenings, conversations and ceremony.
